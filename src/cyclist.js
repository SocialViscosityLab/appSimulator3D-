/**
 * The Cyclist class has visual purpose only. It represents a cyclists in the app, usually as a position on a map. 
 * 
 * If you want to access the position of a cyclist it us usually better to get the cyclist's device position from the
 * instance of devicePosition.js. 
 * 
 * If you need to get the cyclists's position on the map you need to use getPositionOnMap() of the Marker superclass.
